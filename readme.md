####Below is a script files need to be add inside tilter path for bash.
For a better work flow of development, it's nice to have a default running task to be declare in a function inside the bash profile.
######Open the bash profile file in atom
```
$ atom ~/.bash_profile
```

######Insert the code below
```sh
function nodeBoiler {
  args=("$@")

  # clone repo
  git clone https://github.com/kangw3n/node-gulp.git ${args[0]}

  cd ${args[0]}

  # remove git repo
  # rm -rf .git

  #git init
  # git init

  #npm install
  npm install

  #bower install
  # bower install

}


```
Now we can always clone a grunt boilerplates and run all the npm install command in a single steps.
######Clone and install all dependency in 1 code.
```
$ nodeBoiler NAMEOFTHEFOLDER
```
